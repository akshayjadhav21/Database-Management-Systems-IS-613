# Database-Management-Systems-IS613
This course provides an introduction to database concepts, SQL, and web-based database design. The major goal is to provide students with an understanding of the basic concepts underlying the use of a database system. We will be using Microsoft SQL Server and MYSQL Workbench as the primary database management system to illustrate various concepts discussed in the course. In addition, Microsoft Visio 2016 will be the vehicle for illustrating data-modeling diagrams and entity-relationship diagrams.
